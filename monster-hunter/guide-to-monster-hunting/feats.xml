    <description>
      <p>You have unlocked the secrets of the gunlance. While you are attuned to a gunlance, its wyvernfire now recharges on a short or long rest. Additionally, it uses a new type of shell. Choose one of the following shells below that you now use in place of your original shells:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>
            <em>Long Range Shells.</em>
          </strong>
          Your shell's attack range is now 150/600 feet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            <em>Wide Range Shells.</em>
          </strong>
          When you hit a creature with your shell attack, you also deal your damage against a different creature that is within 5 feet of the original target and within range of your weapon.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            <em>Short Range Shells.</em>
          </strong>
          The attack range of your shells is reduced by half, but you can add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage.

        <li>When its hit points reaches 0 it reappears on your insect glaive at full hit points and will resume what it was last doing unless told otherwise.</li>
        <li>It can use its action to absorb a creature's essence in the standard order, but it can return this essence to you or one other creature you designate as an action.</li>
        <li>While being used in this way, you cannot use it to attack as part of your Attack action.</li>

        <li>While you remain on a bigger creature, you can use your action to make an unarmed strike against the creature. On a hit, the creature must use its reaction to move up to half its movement speed in a direction of your choice. If it hits a solid object - that is as big or larger than it - before the end of its movement, the creature is knocked prone. If the creature would enter into any environmental hazard dangerous to the creature (such as falling off a cliff when it can't fly, or into lava when it isn't immune to fire), it instead falls prone in the space adjacent to the hazard.</li>
