		<description>
			<p class="flavor">Wyverians superficially resemble humans, but they have several traits that suggest a wyvern ancestry. They have pointed ears, four-fingered hands, and an increased lifespan. Many, though not all , Wyverians also possess digitigrade legs.</p>
			<h2>A Wyverian's Thinking</h2>
            <p>Wyverians think differently than most races, perhaps in part due to their increased lifespan, and are often considered more intelligent and rational. Some Wyverians have an extensive education, more than most races can learn in a feasible timespan, and are versed in multiple subjects. They are also more attuned to nature, which they greatly respect. They are peaceful and prefer to avoid conflict if possible, but still, recognize the value of Hunters. In fact, they were the first Hunters, but eventually gave way to the Hunter's Guild and transitioned into a supporting role. There are very few Wyverian Hunters today and are considered rarities. Wyverian humor is strange by human standards.</p>

They are small in stature, sometimes a bit stubborn, but always seek to help those lost in the world. Ancient wyverians are usually between 600 and 1000 years old.</p>
